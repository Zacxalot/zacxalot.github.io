      <p>Before I get into anything else, I just want to make it clear that this is my first blog post and the first time since my dissertation that I've written anything longer than a few sentences, so go easy on me.</p>
<h1 id="the-project-flat-blend">The Project - Flat-Blend</h1>
<p>Every time I use any vector editing software, I am frustrated by the limitations of what it can do compared to Blender. So, I‚Äôm trying to make a spinoff of Blender, but it‚Äôs 2D and it‚Äôs written in Rust.</p>
<p>Key things I want out of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Modifiers: Arrays, mirroring, skinning, boolean, all of the fun stuff that would apply to 2D</li>
<li>Edit Mode: No messing about with different coloured cursors, select an object, edit it, put it back</li>
<li>Shortcuts &amp; Controls: I'm a big fan of how Blender controls, big bonus for me</li>
<li>SVG Export</li>
</ul>
<p>For a first goal, I can‚Äôt tell if these are too adventurous or not. The biggest challenge I‚Äôm expecting to face is working with Vulkan. I‚Äôve used a little bit of OpenGL in the past but I‚Äôm having a go of Vulkan this time around and it has a bit of a steeper learning curve. From what I‚Äôve heard though, the difficulty if offset by the room for efficiency that Vulkan offers. </p>
<p>Besides the goals of the end product, I have some meta goals to go along-side:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large Scale Project: Besides my final year university project, I have never done anything personal with objectives as large as this before, so I‚Äôd like to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù something finally</li>
<li>Writing a Blog: I‚Äôve always liked the idea of a blog, even if nobody reads it I feel it‚Äôs a nice way of reflecting on what you have achieved and looking at what you can do next. I also plan for this blog to be an encouragement to myself to carry on with the project to completion</li>
<li>Learning Vulkan: My job title is 3D Software Engineer, so to try and edge myself away from the ever tightening grasp of imposter syndrome, I‚Äôd like to finally learn a graphics API through and through</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="code">Code</h1>
<p>As I've mentioned, I intend to build this project using Rust. Besides me just enjoying using it, it seems like a good fit for what I want to do. It's capable of great performance and has a super handy wrapper around Vulkan called <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/vulkano">Vulkano</a></p>
<p>I jumped into startng a couple weeks ago and got some basic stuff going. Really just got a rendering pipeline in there at the moment, managed to render a square and a circle with orthographic projection. I'm not going into to much detail on what code I've got just yet, I'll save that for a later post. I can however <a href="https://github.com/Zacxalot/flat-blend/">give you a link to the repo</a> and you can look yourself. It's a mess in there at time of writing, don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots!

    <figcaption>Thought I&#x27;d mix it up and render a square rather than a triangle</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img alt="Circle rendered in a window" src=".&#x2F;circle.png" width="100%" style="" />
    <figcaption>72 vertices worth of smooth circly goodness</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>tl;dr I'm making blender but flat.</p>
<p>This might be kind of short in terms of blogs, but it's been a long day and I don't really know what I'm doing üòÖ. Thanks for reading though!</p>
