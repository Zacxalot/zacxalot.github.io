I've had a couple months off from the blog, but I'm going to try and get back into it again.

To jump back in, I'm going to try and figure out how the game [Teardown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167630/Teardown/) renders so many voxels and makes it look so pretty at the same time!

I'm going to carry on with flat blend at some point, it's in dire need of some restructuring to require less boilerplate when adding render passes. Adding that grid took way more effort than I think it should, sapping my motivation along with it.

Before anything, I just want to make it clear that I'll be doing a good amount of guessing here, and my guesses will be wrong in many cases, but hopefully some guesses will be right ðŸ˜….

# Teardown

Teardown is a destruction simulation sandbox game where you warp the environment to complete heists. If you haven't seen any footage of it yet, give some a watch, it's very impressive.

The frame I have captured for analysis doesn't do the games capabilities any justice, but for the sake of figuring out what was going on, I thought it would be best to keep simple.

## Voxels

The first thing in the rendering job list (after clearing the screen, and doing something [with this texture](wtf.png)!?!?) is some voxels! [Voxels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) are the 3D equivalent of pixels. Similarly to 2D images, the data that is stored per voxel doesn't have to be colour values meant for human consumption.

In the case of Teardown, the 3D textures contain references to [indexed colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indexed_color), which are held in a separate texture. This technique was utilised in a lot (sometimes involuntarily) in early games, but it's benefits still ring true in its usage today. By using it in Teardown, the developer saved ~75% of storage per voxel because they only need to store a single colour channel. Due to the extra dimension, voxel data can get very big very quick, so any space saving makes a great impact.


Trying to visualise 3D textures in 2D is difficult, so to give you an good example of how this works, I extracted a 3D texture from the framebuffer in this capture and wrangled it into Blender for some rendering!

Below is a representation of the 3D texture with it's single channel (grey) index values mapped to the colour channels.

{{image(src="indexed.png", alt="a greyscale image of the sign representing the indexed values before they have been mapped to colours" caption="")}}

Along with this, there is the texture that holds all of the colours these index values map to. The image below is just a snippet of the whole texture which contains all of the colours for the scene. This snippet does not necessarily have the colours for the sign. Without diving into the code, I'm guessing that each row is an object.

With both of these, we can get our final colours per voxel. Below is a 2D example of this in action

With the colours applied to our voxels, we get this!
